# How magnets in our refrigerator and social diversity is related each other?

We all love magnets. It’s a cool natural force we see on our everyday life. But what is the relation between magnets and diversity in a sociaty. Well the answer is Ising model.
This model, originally developed in physics to describe the behavior of atoms in a magnet, offers a fascinating way to understand how individual decisions and interactions can lead to larger patterns, whether in physical materials or human societies.

In a magnet, each atom behaves like a tiny magnet or "spin," which can point either up or down. These spins prefer to align with their neighbors, creating a strong, unified magnetic field. However, if the temperature rises, the atoms start to jiggle and can misalign, weakening the overall magnetism. The Ising model uses simple rules to describe this process: each spin interacts with its neighbors, and the overall state of the system emerges from these local interactions.

Now, let’s connect this to neigberhoods in our society in what is called the  Schelling's model of segregation. In Schelling’s model, each person in a neighborhood can be thought of as a “spin” that prefers to align with similar “spins” (people of the same group) nearby. Just as atoms in a magnet seek to align with their neighbors, people in Schelling’s model seek comfort by living near others like themselves. If their local environment doesn't meet their preference, they "flip" by moving to a new location, just like a spin might flip in the Ising model.

This model shows how, without any ill intentions, small personal choices can lead to large-scale segregation. It’s a reminder that our individual actions, when combined with others, can shape the world in ways we might never have imagined. Schelling’s model isn’t just about neighborhoods; it’s a window into understanding how small biases, repeated over time, can create divided societies, even if no one set out to create them.
